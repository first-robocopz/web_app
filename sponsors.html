		We are The Fayette FIRST Robotics team, RoboCopz, a group of motivated young men and women who attend Fayette County High schools with a deep interest in STEM fields
		(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). The RoboCopz are hoping you might be interested in sponsoring our team for the 2015-2016 season.
		</p><p>
		Throughout the year, we design, build, program and compete with robots designed to complete a variety of tasks ranging from simple to complex.
		This year's theme is "First Res-Q". To find out more about the game and the FTC and FRC program, please visit:

		</p><p>
		The RoboCopz are part of a bigger organization called F.I.R.S.T (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology).
		The mission of FIRST is to inspire young people to be leaders in science and technology by engaging them in mentor based programs that build science,
		engineering, and technology skills, while also building self-esteem, life skills, and community awareness.
		</p><p>
		Our team is looking for sponsors who can help us grow and have a greater impact on our community.  We are seeking partnerships that can be associated with us
		as we participate in competitions and community outreach programs.  As a young team, looking to grow our membership, we are ready to take our team to the next level and impact our community. 
		</p><p>
		Funds from sponsors will go towards: robotic parts and kits for competition, marketing supplies, camps and continuing education opportunity, transportation and etc.
		In addition to or in lieu of monetary donation our team appreciates donated materials and mentors.
		</p><p>
		How will your donations benefit your company and the community? We will graciously and vigorously advertise your company on our web-site, team banner
		and during scheduled outreach programs. The opportunity from involvement in F.I.R.S.T and our commitment of giving back to our wonderful community of Fayette County,
		allows for growth for us as a team, as individuals and as a partnership with you.
		</p><p>
		Your donation will help ensure the future of the RoboCopz. Our goal for the 2015-2016 year is to place in the top ten in our division in all of our competitions.
		For the 2015 Fall Competition we are FTC Team #3931 and in the Spring of 2016 we are FRC Team #3344.
